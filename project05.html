			<h3>Homelessness: An Urgent Issue</h3>
				<p>
				Housing represents the fundamental solution to the problem of 
				homelessness, but with the lack of affordable housing and the limited scale 
				of housing assistance programs contributing to the current housing crisis 
				and to homelessness. In addition, 44% of un-housed American residents, 
				of working age and condition, performed some type of work for pay in any 
				given month, but most do not make enough to obtain and retain afford permanent 
				housing. Additionally, many people experiencing homelessness are unable to 
				earn an income due to a permanent or temporary disabling condition.
				</p>
			
			<h3>Homeless Bill of Rights</h3>
			
				<p>Homeless Bill of Rights measures work to ensure that homeless 
				individuals are:</p>
					<!--A list of what the Homeless Bill of Rights measures-->
					<ul>
						<li>Protected against segregation, laws targeting homeless people 
						for their lack of housing and not their behavior, and restrictions 
						on the use of public space.</li>
						<li>Granted privacy and property protections.</li>
						<li>Allowed the opportunity to vote and feel safe in their community 
						without fear or harassment.</li>
						<li>Provided broad access to shelter, social services, legal counsel 
						and quality education for the children of homeless families.</li>
					</ul>

			<h3>Get Involved and Make a Difference</h3>
				<p>You can help end homelessness by simply CAREing!</p>
					<!--A list of how you can help the homeless-->
					<ol>
						<li>C- Contribute (food drives, money, etc.)</li>
						<li>A- Advocate</li>
						<li>R- Reach Out (volunteering)</li>
						<li>E- Educate</li>
					</ol>

				<p>
				CONTRIBUTE: Clothing, household goods or other items, books, computers, 
				homeless "survival kits", phone calls, and job opportunities are 
				<em>always</em> welcome! It is very important to support the homeless during
				their time alone or on the streets and in the transition of getting back
				into society. 
				</p>

				<p>ADVOCATE: Advocacy is critical to creating the systemic changes needed 
				to end homelessness. Advocacy means working with people experiencing 
				homelessness to bring about positive changes in policies and programs on 
				the local, state, and federal levels. It means working with various sectors 
				of the community (e.g. city/county officials, members of Congress, direct 
				service providers, and the business community) to develop workable strategies 
				for responding to homelessness.  It also means changing your language and 
				behaviors in small ways that may contribute to larger changes in the way 
				people experiencing homelessness are seen and treated in our society.
				</p>
				
				<p>REACH OUT: Some ways that you might help are by working in a shelter,
				help to build or fix up houses or shelters, offer professional skills directly
				or assist in job training, share hobbies, invite people experiencing 
				homelessness to a community event, organize an event at a shelter, work 
				with children, and involve others!
				</p>
				
				<p>EDUCATE: Learn about the root causes of homelessness and teach others.  
				NCH maintains updated Facts Sheets on many aspects of homelessness including
				 causes, numbers, and special issues.  Read the Fact Sheets to familiarize 
				 yourself with the latest information, and then share what you learn with 
				 your communityâ€”your place of worship, school, colleagues, friends, 
				 neighbors, media, and elected officials. Be sure to follow NCH on Facebook 
				 and Twitter and repost to spread awareness!
